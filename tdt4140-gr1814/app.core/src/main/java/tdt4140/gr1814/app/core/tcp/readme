TCP SYSTEM IS MADE SO THAT YOU NEED TO START THE SERVER ON A LOCAL OR SEPARATE COMPUTER FIRST

THEN YOU CAN RUN APPLICATION DEMO AND LOGIN AS USUAL

THE ONLY DIFFERENCE NOW IS THAT ONCE YOU LOG IN THE LOGINSCREENSCONTROLLER WILL INITIATE AN INPUTCONTROLLER-OBJECT WHICH IN ITS TURN WOULD 
INITIATE A TCPCLIENT-OBJECT WHICH CONNECTS TO THE SERVER ALREADY RUNNING

ONCE CONNECTION IS ESTABLISHED, THE TCP-CONNECTION WILL SEND A SINGLE STRING EVERY SECOND FROM THE SERVER TO THE CLIENT WHICH SENDS THIS STRING
TO THE INPUTCONTROLLER-OBJECT WHICH METAMORPHISES AND INITIATES THIS FROM A STRING TO A POINT-OBJECT

THEN THIS POINT-OBJECTS'S DEVICE ID IS MATCHED WITH EXISTING PATIENTS AND IF MATCH OCCURS, UPDATES THE LOCATION OF THIS PATIENT
