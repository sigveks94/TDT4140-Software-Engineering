## PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The application provides an alert and tracking system for people with location 
difficulties facilitated elderly, demented, mentally ill and others. Further on,
the application has the ability to monitor the position of users and notify 
relatives, guardians or healthcare personnel if the person has walked outside 
of a custom zone. The application holds as well the ability of the caretakers 
to add one or more people, set the mode of the zones and draw custom maps.
